            Sauteed Zucchini Recipe
        </h3>
        <p>
            This sauteed zucchini is a really easy recipe that tastes great.
            Fresh veggies are lightly cooked together. You can add a cup of 
            cooked pasta if youo wish to give it more heft as a side dish. If 
            there's leftover pasta, it can be used in this too.
