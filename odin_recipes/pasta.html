            <Strong>Steps To Cook:</Strong>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Boil raw pasta according to the instructions given on the package
                    or follow the following instructions; Take 4-5 cups water in deep
                    sauce pan, bring it to a boil over medium flame. When it starts
                    boiling, add 3/4 cup Penne pasta and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Boil them until al-dante (cooked but not very soft). It
                    will take around 10-12 minutes. To check whether pasta is
                    cooked or not, take one pasta in a fork and bite it. If it is 
                    little firm to bite, it is cooked. If it is too hard to bite, it 
                    requires more cooking.
